            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This website is a personal portfolio operated by Mohamed Maa Albared.
                Your privacy is important. This policy explains what data is collected,
                how it's used, and your rights.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Analytics (Automatic)</h3>
            <p>When you visit this site, the following is recorded for analytics purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Page visited</strong> — the URL path you accessed.</li>
                <li><strong>Referrer</strong> — the page that linked you here (if any).</li>
                <li><strong>User agent</strong> — your browser and OS type.</li>
                <li><strong>Country/language</strong> — inferred from your browser's Accept-Language header.</li>
                <li><strong>IP address hash</strong> — your IP is immediately hashed (HMAC-SHA256) with a secret salt.
                    The raw IP address is <strong>never stored</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Contact Form (Voluntary)</h3>
            <p>If you submit the contact form, the following is stored:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name, email address, subject, and message.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is used solely to respond to your inquiry.</p>

            <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                This site uses a <strong>session cookie</strong> for admin authentication only.
                No tracking cookies, advertising cookies, or third-party analytics cookies are used.
                A <code>localStorage</code> key is used to remember your theme preference (dark/light mode).
            </p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>This site loads resources from the following CDNs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Fonts</strong> (fonts.googleapis.com) — for web fonts.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloudflare CDN</strong> (cdnjs.cloudflare.com) — for GSAP animation library.</li>
                <li><strong>jsDelivr</strong> (cdn.jsdelivr.net) — for Chart.js (admin only).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These services may receive your IP address as part of the HTTP request.
                Refer to their respective privacy policies for details.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Page visit analytics</strong> are retained for up to 90 days, then automatically purged.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Contact messages</strong> are retained until manually deleted by the site administrator.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
            <p>
                You may request deletion of any personal data by contacting me through the
                <a href="/#contact" style="color: var(--accent);">contact form</a>.
                Since IP addresses are only stored as irreversible hashes, they cannot be
                linked back to you.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
                All communication is encrypted via HTTPS. Security headers (CSP, HSTS,
                X-Frame-Options, etc.) are enforced. Input is sanitised to prevent XSS
                and injection attacks. Subresource Integrity (SRI) is used for all CDN scripts.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Contact</h2>
            <p>

                <a href="/#contact" style="color: var(--accent);">contact form</a>.
